**A Fragment of Your Imagination**

*Code Fragments and Code Resources for Power Macintosh and Macintosh Programmers*

---

In 1995, my first book, **A Fragment of Your Imagination**, was published by Addison-Wesley.

[Scott Knaster](https://scottknaster.substack.com/) wrote the Foreword which was a real coup for me as a first time author. Scott had already written **How to Write Macintosh Software: The Debugging Reference for Macintosh** and **Macintosh Programming Secrets** - two staples for every early Macintosh programmer.

As you would guess, the book is now extremely out of date but if you're into retro programming, you might still get some use out of it. I make no guarantees as to its usefulness or functionality.

The book is available online, for free, as a PDF at [vintageapple.org](https://vintageapple.org/macprogramming/pdf/A_Fragment_Of_Your_Imagination_1995.pdf) or a ZIP file via [GitHub](https://github.com/zobkiw/fragment/blob/main/A_Fragment_of_Your_Imagination_1995.pdf.zip)

The original (extracted) contents of the CD are available [here](https://github.com/zobkiw/fragment/blob/main/A%20Fragment%20of%20Your%20Imagination%20source%20code.zip)

A dmg file of the CD is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19Zbw0smLRysly6mk8ssonEhf9e4gVEKh/view?usp=sharing) - note it will not mount on some modern versions of macOS easily.
