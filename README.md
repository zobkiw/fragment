A Fragment of Your Imagination

In 1995, my first book, A Fragment of Your Imagination, was published by Addison-Wesley. 

The book is available online, for free, as a PDF at [vintageapple.org](https://vintageapple.org/macprogramming/pdf/A_Fragment_Of_Your_Imagination_1995.pdf)

It is also available [zipped](https://github.com/zobkiw/fragment/blob/main/A_Fragment_of_Your_Imagination_1995.pdf.zip)

The original contents of the CD are available [here](https://github.com/zobkiw/fragment)
